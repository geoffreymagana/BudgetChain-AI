## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and stability, reflecting the financial nature of the application.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), a nearly-white shade of the primary hue, provides a clean and modern backdrop that doesn't distract from the data.
- Accent color: Emerald green (#2E7D32), an analogous color to the primary, offers a vibrant contrast for key actions and visual cues, emphasizing growth and opportunity.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will provide a modern, clean, and easily readable experience.
- Use consistent and clear icons to represent different chains and tokens, enhancing user navigation and understanding.
- Implement a left navigation panel for wallets/chains, a main area for portfolio and transactions, and a right panel for AI insights and alerts.
- Use subtle animations to enhance user experience, such as loading indicators and transitions between different sections.
